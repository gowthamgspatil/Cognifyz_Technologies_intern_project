STEP 2: Set Up File Organization

Create folders for each level and save tasks as separate notebooks/files:

           Level_2/Task2_GeographicAnalysis.ipynb
           Level_3/Task3_Price_vs_Services.ipynb


STEP 3: Perform Analysis for Each Task


Level 1 Tasks: Basic Analysis

These use basic pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
           * Top Cuisines:
                  Read the dataset using pandas
                  Count values of Cuisines column
                  Use .value_counts() to get top 3 cuisines
                  Calculate their % from total
           * City Analysis:
                  Use .value_counts() to get city with most restaurants
                  Use .groupby('City')['Rating'].mean() for avg. rating
                  Find city with max average rating
           * Price Range Distribution:
                  Use .value_counts() or .hist() on Price range
                  Plot with matplotlib or seaborn
                  Calculate percentages of each price category
           * Online Delivery:
                  Check % of restaurants where Online delivery is 'Yes'
                  Compare average ratings using groupby()


Level 2 Tasks: Intermediate Analysis

These require combinations, map plotting, or keyword analysis.
       * Cuisine Combination:
            Use str.split() on Cuisines and explode values
            Count co-occurring cuisine pairs
            Check average ratings for each combo
       * Geographic Analysis:
            Use folium or plotly to plot lat/lon
            Analyze density using clustering (optional: KMeans)
       * Restaurant Chains:
            Check duplicate restaurant names across cities
            Group them and analyze Rating, Votes
       * Reviews Analysis:
            Use nltk or textblob to find sentiment keywords
            Check average review length vs. rating correlation


Level 3 Tasks: Advanced

These involve correlation and relationship analysis.
      * Votes Analysis: 
             Use .sort_values() on Votes
             Use scatterplot or correlation to find relation with Rating
      * Price vs. Online Delivery & Table Booking:
             Use crosstab/heatmap for relationships
             Compare Price range vs Online delivery & Table booking features
