# Data Analysis Intern at Cognifyz Technologies

## 📌 **Project Purpose**

This project is part of an internship with **Cognifyz Technologies**, focused on practical applications of **Data Science** and **Machine Learning** using a restaurant dataset. The main goal is to build analytical and predictive models while gaining hands-on experience with data preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and visualization.

## 🔍 **Key Features & Tasks**

The project is structured into **four distinct tasks**:

### **1. Predicting Restaurant Aggregate Ratings**

* **Objective**: Predict the overall restaurant rating based on features like location, cost, cuisines, etc.
* **Techniques Used**: Regression (Linear/Decision Tree), model evaluation using RMSE, MAE, R².

---

### **2. Restaurant Recommendation System**

* **Objective**: Recommend restaurants based on customer preferences.
* **Approach**:

  * Content-based filtering
  * Similarity metrics (cosine similarity or Jaccard)
* **Output**: Personalized recommendations

---

### **3. Cuisine Classification**

* **Objective**: Classify restaurants based on cuisine types.
* **Model Types**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
* **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix

---

### **4. Geographic Analysis**

* **Objective**: Visualize restaurant locations and ratings on a map.
* **Tools**: `folium`, `plotly`, `geopandas`
* **Insights**:

  * Density heatmaps
  * Top-rated areas
  * Cuisine distribution by region

---

## 🛠️ **Technologies & Tools Used**

* **Languages**: Python
* **Libraries**:

  * `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation
  * `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization
  * `scikit-learn` for ML models
  * `folium` / `plotly` for geographic mapping
* **Environment**: Jupyter Notebooks

---

## 📂 **Repository Structure**

Common files/folders (based on standard Cognifyz structure):

* `task_1_regression/` – code for rating prediction
* `task_2_recommendation/` – recommender system code
* `task_3_classification/` – classification model code
* `task_4_geospatial/` – mapping and spatial analysis
* `README.md` – outlines project goals and instructions

---

## 📄 **Documentation Summary (README.md)**

* Describes each task with a short objective and expected steps.
* Includes brief setup or installation instructions.
* May contain evaluation results and final outputs (charts, maps, etc.).

---

## 🌐 **Potential Applications**

* **Food delivery apps** – to enhance user experience with recommendations and ratings.
* **Tourism platforms** – help tourists find popular or highly rated restaurants.
* **Market research** – understand cuisine trends and customer preferences.
* **Business planning** – choose optimal locations for opening restaurants based on geospatial insights.
